# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using R

This project demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset** and **collaborative filtering techniques** in **R**. It predicts movies a user might enjoy based on the preferences of similar users.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📊 User-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- 🧠 Uses the `recommenderlab` package in R
- 💡 Top-N movie recommendations for individual users
- 📈 Evaluation of model performance (optional)
- 📁 Works with MovieLens 100K dataset

---

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) which contains:

- `movies.csv` — metadata about movies
- `ratings.csv` — user ratings for movies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **R**
- `recommenderlab` — for building recommendation models
- `reshape2`, `dplyr` — for data manipulation
- `ggplot2` — for data visualization
